Overall Summary:
This project implements a web-based "Jungle Chess" (or Animal Chess) game. The application uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and modular JavaScript for game logic, rendering, rules, localization, and AI. A Web Worker is used for the AI computation to prevent blocking the main UI thread. Key modules manage the board state (board.js), game rules (rules.js), visual presentation (renderer.js), language (localization.js), and the AI player (aiWorker.js). The main game flow and user interaction are handled in game.js, initiated by main.js.

It orchestrates the search process, manages search depth and time limits, handles move ordering, but delegates the board state evaluation to aiEvaluate.js. Receives board state and search parameters via onmessage, calculates the best move within limits, and sends the result back via postMessage.
